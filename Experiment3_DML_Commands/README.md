# Experiment 3: DML Commands
## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to reduce the reorder level by 30% where cost price is more than 50 and quantity in stock is less than 100 in the products table.

```sql
update Products
set reorder_lvl=reorder_lvl*0.7
where cost_price>50 and quantity<100;
```

**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query to classify base in the Calculations table as 'Provided' if it is not NULL, otherwise 'Not Provided'.

else 'Not Provided'
end as base_status
from Calculations;
```

**Output:**

**Question 7**
---
Write a SQL query to calculate the final price after applying both the discount and the tax. Return product_id, original_price, discount_percentage, tax_rate, and final_price.

```sql
select product_id,original_price,discount_percentage,tax_rate,(original_price*(1-discount_percentage))*(1+tax_rate) as final_price
from products;
```

**Output:**

select upper(FirstName) AS FirstName,upper(LastName) AS LastName,EmployeeId
from employees
order by EmployeeID desc;
```

**Output:**
